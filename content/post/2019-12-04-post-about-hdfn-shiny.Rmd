App created in R/Shiny to illustrate fetal physiology.  
This should NOT be taken as medical advice, but feel free to play around with the inputs.

Note, this an approximation: the decline in fetal hematocrit (hct) seen here will vary depending upon the degree to which fetal erythropoeisis has been suppressed by prior transfusions.  

Clearly, using a combined IVT+IPT approach maintains a higher post-transfusion hct compared with IVT alone.
